# Portfoilio

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I created a website that details the experiences that I have been apart of over the course of my entire life. I also linked all of my social medias so that potential people viewing my website could contact me for potential interviews, calls, etc.

I have also wrote about things that make me unique including leadership, contact information, as well as buttons that connect all the links and different parts of the website.
